This repository contains some test `CellML <https://www.cellml.org/>`_ files for `libCellML <https://github.com/cellml/libcellml>`_.
They are based on the `https://github.com/ModellingWebLab/cellmlmanip/blob/develop/tests/cellml_files/test_simple_odes.cellml <https://github.com/ModellingWebLab/cellmlmanip/blob/develop/tests/cellml_files/test_simple_odes.cellml>`_.

The |cellml-folder|_ folder contains the CellML 1.0/1.1 version of those models while |cellml-2.0-folder|_ folder contains the CellML 2.0 version of those same models (which was obtained using `cellml1to2 <https://github.com/cellml/cellml1to2>`_).
